# Technical_Coding

This repository contains modular, well-documented solutions to five coding problems assigned in the technical coding interview round. Each problem includes:
- A clear problem statement
- Python code implementation
- Sample test cases with input/output
- Self-contained script ready to run
# 1: Sudoku Validator With Custom Zones
-Validate a 9x9 Sudoku board with the following constraints:
-Each row, column, and 3x3 box must contain digits 1-9 exactly once.
-Additionally, you are given custom zones, each consisting of 9 unique cells. Each custom zone must also contain digits 1-9 exactly once.
   
# 2: Alien Dictionary
 -Given a sorted list of words from an alien language, determine the character order used in that language.
# 3: Knights and Portals
-You are given a grid with cells marked as 0 (empty) or 1 (obstacle). Find the shortest path from the top-left to bottom-right.
-You are allowed to teleport once between any two empty cells.
# 4: Bitwise Matching Pattern
-Given a positive integer n, return the next higher integer that has the same number of binary 1s as n.
# 5: Matrix Islands With Diagonals
-Given a 2D matrix of 0s and 1s, count the number of islands.
-Islands are groups of connected 1s â€” connected vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
